1. Create class AgeValidation
2. Prompt the user to enter their age.
3. Use try–catch–throw–finally.
4. If age > 18 → print “Age is valid. Access granted.”
5. If age <= 18 → throw an exception with a message like “Invalid age. You must be over 18.”
6. In the catch block → display the exception message.
7. In the finally block → always print “Program execution completed.”
